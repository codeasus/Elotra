    During the project as we had less time, mobile responsiveness was not priority. Therefore, if some files do not not scale well on mobile screen resolutions, it is because the project was intented to be a prototype.    

###Note
    trip.html has an implemented javascript carousel towards the bottom of the page. Therefore you can swipe left and right just to have a bit of fun.
